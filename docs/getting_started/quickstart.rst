Quickstart
----------

LISBET operations are performed through a command-line interface called ``betman``.
This tool provides commands for all main functionalities: computing embeddings from tracking data, training classification models, segmenting behavioral motifs, and more.
Each operation can be customized through various parameters to suit your specific needs.
How to use ``betman`` is described in our :ref:`user-guide`.
For a complete reference of all commands and options, see the :ref:`api-reference`.

For analyzing LISBET's results, we provide a collection of Python functions that can be used in scripts or Jupyter notebooks.
These tools help you visualize motifs, compute statistics, and correlate behavioral patterns with other experimental measures like neural recordings.
See our :ref:`analysis-examples` for detailed demonstrations.
